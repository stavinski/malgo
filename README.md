Does what it say's on the tin...Malicious Go! 

## wifi pwds

Retrieve WLAN passwords from Windows. Uses native calls in Win32 API rather than executing `netsh wlan ...` as a command, this approach is more stealthy!

## inject

Injects a DLL into a remote process uses the classic on disk / `LoadLibrary` approach so should be used primarily for testing as it is not opsec safe.

Usage:

~~~
inject_x64.exe <dll_path> <pid>
